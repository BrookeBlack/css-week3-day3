# Vacation Guide Website

This repository contains the code for a simple vacation guide website. It is designed to help beginners learn how to style a webpage using CSS. The project focuses on key CSS concepts such as the Box Model, Flexbox, and general webpage styling.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply the **CSS Box Model** to structure and space elements.
- Use **CSS Flexbox** to create responsive layouts.
- Style a webpage using CSS properties such as colors, margins, padding, and hover effects.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar:** Stays at the top and highlights links on hover.
- **Article Section:** Uses Flexbox to align and space content.
- **Table:** Displays vacation spots with structured styling.
- **Footer:** Completes the webpage with a styled section.

## Understanding the CSS Concepts Used
### 1. CSS Box Model
- Every element in the webpage follows the box model, which consists of:
  - **Content** (text, images, etc.)
  - **Padding** (space inside the border)
  - **Border** (the outline of the element)
  - **Margin** (space outside the border)

### 2. CSS Flexbox
- The `.articles` section uses Flexbox to evenly space the articles.
- The `.navbar` uses Flexbox to align menu items in a row.
- Flex properties such as `justify-content` and `gap` help in spacing.

### 3. Styling Elements
- **Navigation links change color on hover** to improve user interaction.
- **Box shadows and rounded corners** make elements visually appealing.
- **Borders and spacing** enhance readability and structure.
